# Sort-Visualizer in C++

* A Sort Visualizer project written in C++ which will display sorting of an array with different sorting techniques.

* The Array/Vector is of size 100 and the elements are placed in random order from 1-100.

* The user will be prompted to sort the array with any technique.

* Visualization has been done with the help of SDL library in C++.

* Note: SDL is not included in any of the header file, SDL's dll need to be linked at the time of the compilation with the help of the compilation flags.

* However g++ compilation command and SDL library and dll has been shared in the repository
